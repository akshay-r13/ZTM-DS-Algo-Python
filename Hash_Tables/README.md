# Hash Tables

Hash tables are also called as 
1. Hash Maps
2. Maps
3. Unordered maps
4. Objects
5. Dictionary

Many languges have their own implementation of hash tables

Hash function used to generate keys for Hash tables

What is a hash function?

md5, sha1, sha256

idempotent

hash table hash function hashes input to index space / address space

quick hashing function is more suitable

Operation Times
Insert O(1)
delete O(1)
lookup O(1)
search O(1)

Example:
```

```


When a hash table is created. The system allocates a part of memory for the table

Memory to be used for one entry in the hash table is generated by the hash table.

Hash collision -> When 2 different input values generate the same hash value

During hash collision, multiple objects are assigned to same memory space.

Hash collision can be resolved in multiple ways.
1. ..
2. ..


In programming languages you can have functions as hash table values

In Hash Map insertion order is maintained.

Sets similar to map but only save keys
