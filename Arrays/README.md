# Arrays

Arrays have the smallest footprint of any data strucure. 
As they are stored contiguous in memory.

## Static & Dynamic Arrays

Dynamic arrays may have O(n) time for append operation. Since Dynamci arrays auto resize when they reach capacity. During this action all current elements are cloned to a new bigger array.

## Strings

Strings are just array of characters. Treat string questions as Array questions
